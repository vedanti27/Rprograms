### Installation and Pre-requistes
To set up and configure R programming using RStudio, follow these steps:

1. **Install R**: First, you need to install R on your system. You can download it from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at https://cran.r-project.org/. Choose the version that matches your operating system (Windows, MacOS, Linux), download it, and follow the installation instructions.

2. **Install RStudio**: RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It provides a user-friendly interface and tools to help you use R more effectively. You can download RStudio from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/. Again, choose the version that matches your operating system, download it, and follow the installation instructions.

3. **Configure RStudio**: After installing RStudio, you can configure it to suit your needs. Here are some basic configurations you might want to make:

   - **Set your working directory**: This is the directory where RStudio will look for files and save your work. You can set it by going to `Tools -> Global Options -> General -> Default working directory`.

   - **Choose your CRAN mirror**: This is the server from which you'll download packages. You can set it by going to `Tools -> Global Options -> Packages -> CRAN mirror`.

   - **Manage your packages**: R packages are collections of functions and data sets developed by the community. You can install, update, and manage your packages by going to `Tools -> Install Packages`.

4. **Start using RStudio**: Now you're ready to start using RStudio. You can write your R code in the script editor, and then run it by clicking the `Run` button or pressing `Ctrl+Enter` (or `Cmd+Enter` on a Mac). The results will appear in the console.
